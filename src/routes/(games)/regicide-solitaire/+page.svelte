	<p>
		In Regicide Solitaire your goal is to defeat 12 powerful enemies. You play cards from your hand
		to attack the enemy and once enough damage is dealt, the enemy is defeated. You win when the
		last King is defeated. But beware! Each turn the enemy strikes back. You discard cards from your
		hand to satisfy the damage and if you canâ€™t discard enough, you lose!
